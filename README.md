### Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

---
No problem. Here is a version of the project brief, formatted to mimic the step-by-step instructions from Codecademy, with the hints separated. You can use a second markdown file in the GitHub repository (e.g., `HINTS.md`) to hold the hints, and simply link to it from the main `README.md` file.

-----

### **1. Get Started**

This project is intended to be completed on your own computer. To successfully finish the project, make sure to download the images that are linked above. There’s no single, correct way to complete this project, so experiment and have fun\!

If you do want more assistance, i.e., read a transcription of the image for more guidance, please see the [HINTS.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=HINTS.md) file. Otherwise, you can use the design image as a blueprint for your project\!

### **2. Build the Header**

Create the main header section of the page. This includes the large, centered heading for the business name.

### **3. Add the Brushes Section**

Below the header, create the first content section for "Brushes." This section should include the H2 header, the image, and all the associated text and pricing.

### **4. Add the Frames Section**

Create the second content section for "Frames." This section will follow the same pattern as the previous one, with a new H2 header, image, and text.

### **5. Add the Paint Section**

Create the final content section for "Paint." This section should include the H2 header, the image, and all the associated text and pricing.

### **Project Hints & Specifications**


### **Project Brief**

Welcome to your first off-platform project! For this assignment, you will build a simple, single-page website for a fictional arts and crafts store called Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts. This project is a great opportunity to apply your HTML and CSS skills outside of the Codecademy environment.

The goal is to recreate a provided design specification, just like you would for a client in a real-world web development job. This is a chance to practice **self-directed learning**, so you are encouraged to use online resources, documentation, and the hints provided below to solve problems on your own.

### **Getting Started**

1.  **Accept the assignment** on GitHub Classroom. This will create a private repository for you.
2.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git.
3.  **Open the project folder** in your preferred text editor (like VS Code or Sublime Text). You'll find a basic file structure and the necessary images.
4.  **Start building!** You'll be working with `index.html` and `style.css`.

### **Project Requirements**

To complete this project successfully, your website must include:

* A logical folder structure with separate files for your HTML and CSS.
* An `index.html` file to build the page content.
* A `style.css` file to handle all the styling.
* All four of the provided images: `pattern.jpg`, `hacksaw.jpeg`, `frames.jpeg`, and `finnish.jpeg`.

Good luck, and remember, a key part of this project is learning to problem-solve on your own. If you get stuck, try searching online for a solution or consulting your Codecademy materials. You've got this!
