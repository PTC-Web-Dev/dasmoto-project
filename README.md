# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

**Project Overview**

In this project, you will build a simple, responsive website for a fictional arts and crafts store. This project is designed to give you experience working with HTML and CSS on your local machine and managing your work with Git and GitHub.

**Requirements**
* A logical folder structure for your project files.
* An `index.html` file.
* A `style.css` file.
* Use the provided images.

**Design Specification**

(Here, you can copy and paste the `Additional Help` and `Tasks` sections from the project brief, formatted nicely with Markdown headings and bullet points.)

### **3. Set Up the GitHub Classroom Assignment**

1.  **Go to GitHub Classroom**: Navigate to your GitHub Classroom organization. If you haven't set one up, you'll need to do that first.
2.  **Create a new assignment**: Select "New assignment" and give it a descriptive name, like "Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts".
3.  **Choose the assignment type**: Select "Individual assignment".
4.  **Set the starter code**: This is the most important part. Choose the option to "Import starter code" from an existing repository. You'll need to create a new, private repository in your GitHub account with the starter files you prepared in step 1. Name this repository something like `dasmoto-starter-code`.
5.  **Configure settings**:
    * **Repository naming prefix**: `dasmotos-arts-and-crafts-` (GitHub will automatically append each student's username to this).
    * **Visibility**: "Private" is best so students can work independently and you can view their progress.
    * **Feedback**: You can enable "Continuous feedback" to leave comments on their code as they work.
    * **Invites**: Generate an invite link for your students. You can share this link in Slack or Google Classroom.

### **Why this approach works**

* **Workplace Simulation**: By providing starter files and a `README.md` with specifications, you are simulating a real-world scenario where a developer is given a project brief and assets.
* **Encourages Self-Directed Learning**: The project intentionally provides less hand-holding. The hints are in the `README`, but the students are expected to use them as a guide, not a step-by-step instruction manual. This pushes them to use external resources like documentation and search engines to solve problems, a critical skill for any developer.
* **Git Practice**: Students will learn the essential workflow of `git clone`, making changes, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` in a practical context. This is a fundamental skill that will prepare them for future group projects and job interviews.
